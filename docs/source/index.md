# JupyterHub Traefik Proxy

An implementation of the JupyterHub proxy api with [traefik](https://traefik.io) : an extremely lightweight, portable reverse proxy implementation, that supports load balancing and can configure itself automatically and dynamically.

## Why traefik?

Currently, the **default** proxy implementation for JupyterHub is [configurable-http-proxy](https://github.com/jupyterhub/configurable-http-proxy) (CHP), which stores the routing table in-memory. This might be the best approach in most of the cases, but because you can only run a single copy of the proxy at a time, it has its limitations when used in dynamic large scale systems.

When using a proxy implementation based on traefik, you can run multiple instances of traefik by using a distributed key-value store like [etcd](https://coreos.com/etcd) or [consul](https://www.consul.io/) to store the routing table. This makes the proxy **highly available** and improves the scalability and stability of the system.
Moreover it offers _HTTPS_ support through a straight-forward [ACME (Let's Encrypt)](https://docs.traefik.io/configuration/acme) configuration.

There are three versions for the proxy, depending on how traefik stores the routes:

- _for_ **smaller**, _single-node deployments_:
  - TraefikFileProviderProxy
- _for_ **distributed** _setups_:
  - TraefikEtcdProxy
  - TraefikConsulProxy
